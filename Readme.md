## 🧭 Overview

Modern codebases grow faster than human comprehension. Sentinel Flow bridges that gap by continuously parsing, indexing, and visualizing your code as a living knowledge graph — enriched by AI that understands both structure and semantics.

Whether you're onboarding to an unfamiliar project, hunting down a hidden dependency, or planning a large-scale refactor, Sentinel Flow gives you the context you need instantly.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Intelligent Code Indexing

Sentinel Flow parses your codebase at the AST level using Tree-sitter, providing symbol-accurate analysis rather than simple text scanning.

- Multi-language AST parsing — TypeScript, Python, and C supported out of the box
- Incremental indexing with content-hash-based change detection (only re-parses what changed)
- Worker-thread architecture keeps the VS Code UI fully responsive during indexing
- SQLite-backed graph database with O(1) symbol lookups

### 🗺️ Interactive Graph Visualization

Three purpose-built view modes let you zoom from 30,000 feet to individual function calls.

| Mode | What It Shows | Best For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Architecture** | High-level domain and module structure | Understanding system organization |
| **Codebase** | Files, symbols, and their relationships | Detailed code navigation |
| **Trace** | Function call chains and impact paths | Debugging and change impact analysis |

All views support real-time filtering, search, and progressive disclosure. Layout is powered by ELK.js for clean, automatic graph rendering.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis

A dual-path AI architecture routes every query to the right model for the job — balancing speed against analytical depth.

```
User Query → Intent Router → Reflex Path (<300ms) or Strategic Path (2–5s)
```

- **Reflex Path** (Groq / Llama 3.1 70B): Near-instant answers for quick lookups and tooltip explanations
- **Strategic Path** (Google Gemini / AWS Bedrock): Deep architectural analysis, refactoring plans, and security audits
- Context-aware prompts include the dependency graph and code metrics for every query
- Response caching prevents redundant API calls and reduces costs

### 🔬 Inspector Panel

Click any node in the graph to open a rich details panel:

- Real-time metrics: cyclomatic complexity, coupling, and fragility scores
- Dependency map: all incoming and outgoing relationships at a glance
- Risk assessment with AI-generated plain-English explanations
- Health score for domains, files, and individual symbols

### 🧹 Technical Debt Detection

- Automated identification of code smells and anti-patterns
- Complexity and coupling metrics with trend tracking
- Blast radius analysis — see exactly which symbols would be affected by a change
- AI-generated, actionable refactoring suggestions

## ⚖️ Design Decisions & Trade-Offs

To achieve enterprise-grade performance entirely within the local VS Code environment, we had to make specific architectural choices over standard alternatives:

| Technology Choice | The Alternative | Why We Chose It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tree-sitter (WASM)** | *Regex or Standard AST Parsers* | Regex is too fragile for complex code, and standard parsers are slow. Tree-sitter allows us to do **incremental, language-agnostic parsing** at native speeds directly in the browser/worker environment. |
| **SQLite (sql.js)** | *In-Memory JSON or Neo4j* | Neo4j requires external hosting (breaking local privacy). In-memory JSON crashes VS Code on large codebases. SQLite gives us **ACID transactions, O(1) lookups, and minimal memory footprint**. |
| **Dual-Path AI (Groq + Gemini)** | *Routing everything to GPT-4o* | Using a single large model for everything creates terrible UX (3–5s wait times for simple tooltips). Routing "Reflex" queries to **Groq (Llama 3.1) gives us <300ms latency**, saving the heavy lifting for Gemini. |
| **ELK.js Layout Engine** | *D3.js or Force-Directed Graphs* | Force-directed graphs turn into a messy "hairball" with 500+ nodes. ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel) provides **deterministic, hierarchical layering** which is essential for reading architectural domains. |
| **Worker Thread Architecture** | *Running logic in Extension Host* | Running AST extraction and DB queries in the main extension host would freeze the VS Code UI. Isolating this in a **background worker thread** ensures 60 FPS scrolling and typing, even while indexing 5,000 files. |

---

### View Modes

#### Architecture Mode
Renders your project as a high-level domain map. Folders become architectural domains; edges represent cross-domain dependencies. Use this when you need to orient yourself in an unfamiliar codebase or plan a cross-cutting change.

#### Codebase Mode
Displays the full symbol graph at three depth levels — Domain → File → Symbol — with edges showing imports and function calls. Use this for detailed code navigation and tracing exact dependency chains.

#### Trace Mode
Isolates a function's call chain and visualizes its blast radius: every symbol that would be affected by a change. Use this for debugging, impact analysis, and planning safe refactors.

### Inspector Panel

Click any node to open the Inspector Panel on the right:

- **Overview** — basic metrics and file metadata
- **Dependencies** — incoming and outgoing relationship list
- **Risks & Health** — complexity, coupling, and fragility scores with color-coded indicators
- **AI Actions** — generate explanations, suggest refactors, or run a security audit on the selected symbol

### Search & Filtering

- **Search Bar** — filter by symbol name or AI-generated tags (minimum 3 characters)
- **Domain Filter** — scope the graph to a specific architectural domain
- **Sort Options** — sort by name, complexity, fragility, or blast radius
- **Depth Control** — toggle between Domain, File, and Symbol level views

- **Disabled** — manual indexing only via the Command Palette

---

## 📈 Performance

### Optimization Techniques

Sentinel Flow is engineered to stay fast on codebases of any size through several layered strategies:

- **Incremental Indexing** — only re-parses files whose content hash has changed
- **Worker Thread Isolation** — CPU-intensive parsing never blocks the VS Code UI thread
- **Binary String Registry** — O(1) symbol lookups via pre-interned string identifiers
- **Composite Index** — fast cross-file edge resolution without full table scans
- **Response Caching** — AI responses are cached in SQLite to avoid redundant API calls
- **Progressive Disclosure** — the graph renderer only processes nodes currently in the viewport
- **Edge Deduplication** — repeated relationships are collapsed to reduce visual clutter

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Small (50 files) | Medium (500 files) | Large (5,000 files) |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Symbols | 500 | 5,000 | 50,000 |
| Initial Index | ~2s | ~15s | ~120s |
| Incremental Update | < 100ms | < 500ms | < 2s |
| Graph Render | < 100ms | < 300ms | < 1s |
| AI Query (Reflex) | < 300ms | < 300ms | < 300ms |
| AI Query (Strategic) | 2–5s | 2–5s | 2–5s |
